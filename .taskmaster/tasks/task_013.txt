# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Project Clone and Update Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to clone existing projects for new niches and update projects without recreation
# Details:
Implement features that enable project reusability: clone command to duplicate a project with adapted configurations for new niches, and update command to modify existing projects without starting from scratch. This ensures the app is not 'one-and-done' but a scalable tool for ongoing campaigns.

# Test Strategy:
Tests for project cloning with configuration changes, update operations preserving existing data, version control compatibility tests.
