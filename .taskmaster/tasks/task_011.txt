# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Project Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create isolated project folder structure with inputs/, configs/, outputs/ subdirectories for campaign reusability
# Details:
Implement a project management system that creates isolated folders for each campaign (e.g., projects/plumbing_campaign/). Each project should be self-contained with its own inputs, configurations, and outputs. This enables easy cloning and recreation of campaigns across different niches without code changes.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for folder creation, configuration loading, and project validation. Integration tests for project cloning and updates.
